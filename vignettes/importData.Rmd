The  Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) has a broad data collection.  See their history [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/about/history/timeline.html). Specifically, they have two studies on India.

The [India Human Development Survey - I](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/22626) and [India Human Development Survey - II](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/36151?q=india+human+development+survey&searchSource=icpsr-landing) have provided documentation on their studies.  They have also provided the data download in multiple file formats under the 'Download' button. We recommend the 'Delimeted' format.

We used the following files for this example;

- The 2005 survey is named `ICPSR_22626`. 
- The 2011 survey is named `ICPSR_36151`. 

Thanks to Frederick Solt and the [icpsrdata package](https://github.com/fsolt/icpsrdata) we can use the `icpsr_download()` function as well.  This guide will use the data retrieved from `icpsr_download()` function.
